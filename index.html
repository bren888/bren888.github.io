		<p>As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain," Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He reveals that he made "boom boom" (Finn's word for defecation) on a large leaf, then fell on it, and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret (Jake's parents) rescued him from the wilderness. They raised him alongside Jake, who, along with Jermaine, became Finn's adopted brother. In "Memory of a Memory," a baby Finn is seen singing a song in the bathroom of what appears to be Joshua and Margaret's house. In "Henchman," when Finn is asked about his parents, he says Jake told him that he came from a cabbage as a jest. In "Susan Strong," Finn states that he knows nothing of his human parents or any other humans.</p>

		<p>Finn is a 15-year-old human. He is roughly five feet tall. He has several missing teeth because he bites trees and rocks among other things.<br><br>Although his eyes typically lack detail and appear as small black dots due to a minor mutation, they are shown to have color in "The Enchiridion!" when Finn is tried by the Dark Magician. His left eye is green while his right eye is blue, characteristic of the genetic condition heterochromia. However, as stated by lead character designer Andy Ristaino on Spring, "That was a special occasion. The heterochromatic effect was a byproduct of him being hypnotized by that guardian dude." Andy confirmed that Finn's eyes are blue</p>
